## About me

I am a computational research scientist in [Dr. Loren Frank's lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/) at [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My work focuses on developing scalable, interpretable algorithms and tools to decode, categorize and visualize neural representations. This work extends and applies marked point process switching state space models I developed during my postdoc with [Dr. Uri T. Eden](https://math.bu.edu/people/tzvi/). I work closely with experimental collaborators to ensure these algorithms and tools are usable on large-scale data.

I also build open source software packages for neural data analysis. These include:

+ [replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification) a Python package for decoding spatial position represented by neural activity and categorizing the type of trajectory.
+ [Spyglass](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass) is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis, visualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It is designed to be interoperable with the [NWB format](https://www.nwb.org/) (a data standard for neurophysiology) and integrates open-source tools such as [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) into a coherent framework.
+ [spectral_connectivity](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/spectral_connectivity) is a Python software package that computes multitaper spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures such as coherence, spectral granger causality, and the phase lag index using the multitaper Fourier transform.

Previously, I completed my PhD in computational neuroscience at Boston University with Drs. [Daniel H. Bullock](https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/daniel-bullock/) and [Earl K. Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/). There I developed computational tools and models to understand how prefrontal cortex supports the underlying neural computations necessary to switch between contexts. Specifically:

+ I showed how synchronous network oscillations in the prefrontal cortex provide a mechanism to flexibly coordinate context representations between groups of neurons during task switching
+ I used generalized additive models to show that anterior cingulate neurons can represent context, but do not play a significant role in switching between contexts
+ Finally, I developed a set of web-enabled interactive visualization tools designed to provide a multi-dimensional integrated view of electrophysiological datasets.

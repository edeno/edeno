[replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification) is a Python package for decoding spatial position represented by neural activity and categorizing the type of trajectory. It can decode both clustered and unclustered spiking activity and can take advantage of the GPU for faster computation.

[Spyglass](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass) is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis, visualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It is designed to be interoperable with the [NWB format](https://www.nwb.org/) (a data standard for neurophysiology) and integrates open-source tools such as [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) into a coherent framework

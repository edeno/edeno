[replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification) is a Python package for decoding spatial position represented by neural activity and categorizing the type of trajectory. It can decode both clustered and unclustered spiking activity and can take advantage of the GPU for faster computation.

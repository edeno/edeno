# Projects

Code for most of my projects can be found on my [Github page](https://github.com/edeno). Here are some select projects I've worked on:

  :text-align: start

  [replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification) is a Python package for decoding spatial position represented by neural activity and categorizing the type of trajectory. It can decode both clustered and unclustered spiking activity and can take advantage of the GPU for faster computation.

  ::: card Spyglass
  :img-top: ../_static/spyglass.png
  :text-align: start

  [Spyglass](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass) is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis, visualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It is designed to be interoperable with the [NWB format](https://www.nwb.org/) and integrates open-source tools such as [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) into a coherent framework.

  ::: card Spectral Connectivity
  :img-top: ../_static/spectral_connectivity.png
  :text-align: start

  [spectral_connectivity](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/spectral_connectivity) is a Python software package that computes multitaper spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures such as coherence, spectral granger causality, and the phase lag index using the multitaper Fourier transform.

  ::: card RasterVis
  :img-top: ../_static/RasterVis.gif
  :text-align: start

  [RasterVis](https://github.com/NeurophysVis/RasterVis) is an interactive JavaScript-based neuroscience visualization tool for quickly viewing, grouping, and summarizing spike rasters for many neurons. It allows you to generate and change between rasters, align to trial events, add Gaussian-smoothed peristimulus time kernel density estimates, and group spikes by experimental factors.

  :text-align: start

  [SpectraVis](https://github.com/NeurophysVis/SpectraVis) is an interactive JavaScript-based tool for analyzing task-related functional networks over time and frequency. It lets you compare local and global dynamics, explore different connectivity measures, and switch between multiple network views.

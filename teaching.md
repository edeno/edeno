# Teaching

## University of California, San Francisco

Frank lab Python tutorial
(August, 2021)

+ I led a tutorial series for the lab that covers Python basics, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. [Tutorial Code](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/franklab_python_tutorial)

## Boston University

**Co-organizer of CELEST Summer Undergraduate Training Program for NSF funded Science of Learning Center**
(Summer, 2014-2015)

+ The program provided research and training experience for under-represented groups in neuroscience. It included professional development seminars covering various issues, including on how graduate training is funded, what a successful graduate application looks like, how implicit bias can influence careers, how to organize scientific presentations, how to write effective papers, and other topics. I helped organize the professional development seminars, led programming tutorials, and led laboratory tours for two summers. [Matlab Tutorial](https://github.com/edeno/CELEST-Matlab-Tutorial)

**Teaching Fellow for CN540 - Neural and Computational Models of Adaptive Movement Planning and Control.**
(January, 2014  - May, 2014)

+ I created a [final project assignment and neural network model](https://github.com/edeno/project-assignment-visuomotor-reach-adaptation) inspired by [Bullock et al. (1993)](http://www.cns.bu.edu/Profiles/Grossberg/BulGroGue1993JOCN.pdf) and [Grosse-Wentrup and Vidal (2007)](http://www.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/GrosseWentrupVidal2007_BioCyb_%5B0%5D.pdf). The project challenges the student to understand how the brain learns to perform visually-guided reaches by integrating both motor and visual sensory feedback. In order to complete the assignment, the student must show understanding of the neural network model by adding additional features to the model and by critiquing the added features.

**Teaching Fellow for CAS NE 340 - Introduction to Computational Models of Skilled Decision and Action.**
(January, 2011  - May, 2011)

+ I gave a lecture on task switching, led a Matlab tutorial, and assisted lectures in the computer lab.

## University of California, Santa Barbara

University of California, Santa Barbara Campus Learning Assistance Services - Mathematics Tutor
(September, 2005 - June, 2007)

+ I tutored students in college level mathematics courses including calculus and linear algebra.

## About me

I am a computational research scientist in the [lab of Loren M. Frank](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/) at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco. My work is focused on applying and extending marked point process state space models to categorize and decode hippocampal representations. This work continues models I developed during my postdoctoral research with [Uri T. Eden](https://math.bu.edu/people/tzvi/).

My doctoral research with [Daniel H. Bullock](https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/daniel-bullock/) and [Earl K. Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/) focused on how subregions of the prefrontal cortex support the underlying neural comptuations necessary to switch between contexts. I showed how synchronous network oscillations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide a mechanism to flexibly coordinate context representations (rules) between groups of neurons during task switching. I also, using Generalized Additive modeling, showed that, although anterior cingulate neurons can represent rules, the neurons do not play a significant role in switching between contexts â€” rather they seem to be more related to errors and motivational drive. Finally, I develop a set of web-enabled interactive visualization tools designed to provide a multi-dimensional integrated view of electrophysiological datasets.

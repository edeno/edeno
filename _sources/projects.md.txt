# Projects

Code for most of my projects can be found on my [Github page](https://github.com/edeno). Here are some select projects I've worked on:

[replay_trajectory_classification](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/replay_trajectory_classification) is a python package for decoding spatial position represented by neural activity and categorizing the type of trajectory.

[Spyglass](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass) is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis, visualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible research. It is designed to be interoperable with the NWB format and integrates open-source tools into a coherent frameworks.

[spectral_connectivity](https://github.com/Eden-Kramer-Lab/spectral_connectivity) is a Python software package that computes multitaper spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures such as coherence, spectral granger causality, and the phase lag index using the multitaper Fourier transform.

[SpectraVis](https://github.com/NeurophysVis/SpectraVis) is a interactive javascript-based neuroscience visualization tool for analyzing task-related functional networks over time and frequency. It allows users to examine how network dynamics change over time and frequency, compare local (statistical dependencies between a single pair of nodes) and global (statistical dependencies between all nodes) dynamics., compare different types of functional connectivity measures (correlation, coherence) and switch between multiple network views for better understanding of the network structure.

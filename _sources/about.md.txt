# About me

My doctoral research with [Daniel H. Bullock](https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/daniel-bullock/) and [Earl K. Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/) focused on how subregions of the prefrontal cortex support the underlying neural comptuations necessary to switch between contexts.

My postdoctoral research with [Uri T. Eden](https://math.bu.edu/people/tzvi/) focused on developing marked point process state space models to categorize and decode hippocampal replay.

I am now a research scientist in the lab of Loren M. Frankat Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco.

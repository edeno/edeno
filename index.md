## About me

I am a computational research scientist in [Dr. Loren Frank's lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/) at [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My work focuses on developing algorithms and tools to categorize and decode neural representations. This work extends and applies marked point processes switching state space models I developed during my postdoctoral research with [Uri T. Eden](https://math.bu.edu/people/tzvi/).

Previously, I completed my PhD in computational neuroscience at Boston University with [Daniel H. Bullock](https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/daniel-bullock/) and [Earl K. Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/). There I developed computational tools and models to understand how prefrontal cortex supports the underlying neural comptuations necessary to switch between contexts. Specifically, I showed how synchronous network oscillations in the prefrontal cortex provide a mechanism to flexibly coordinate context representations between groups of neurons during task switching, I used generalized additive models to show that anterior cingulate neurons can represent context, but do not play a significant role in switching between contexts and finally, I developed a set of web-enabled interactive visualization tools designed to provide a multi-dimensional integrated view of electrophysiological datasets.

## About me

I am a computational research scientist in [Dr. Loren Frank's lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/) at [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My work focuses on developing scalable, interpretable algorithms and tools to decode, categorize and visualize neural representations. This work extends and applies marked point process switching state space models I developed during my postdoc with [Dr. Uri T. Eden](https://math.bu.edu/people/tzvi/). I work closely with experimental collaborators to ensure these algorithms and tools are usable on large scale data.

Previously, I completed my PhD in computational neuroscience at Boston University with Drs. [Daniel H. Bullock](https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/daniel-bullock/) and [Earl K. Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/). There I developed computational tools and models to understand how prefrontal cortex supports the underlying neural comptuations necessary to switch between contexts. Specifically:

+ I showed how synchronous network oscillations in the prefrontal cortex provide a mechanism to flexibly coordinate context representations between groups of neurons during task switching
+ I used generalized additive models to show that anterior cingulate neurons can represent context, but do not play a significant role in switching between contexts
+ Finally, I developed a set of web-enabled interactive visualization tools designed to provide a multi-dimensional integrated view of electrophysiological datasets.
